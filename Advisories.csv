Researchers have identified a vulnerability that affects all versions of Windows Workstation and Server, from Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 to the most recent Windows 11 v24H2 and Server 20221. This vulnerability enables an attacker to obtain a user's NTLM credentials merely by having the user view a malicious file in Windows Explorer.
This vulnerability can be exploited if a user opens a shared folder or USB drive containing such a file or views the Downloads folder where the file was previously downloaded from a malicious web page. The issue has been reported to Microsoft, and 0patch has provided micropatches to address it temporarily. These micropatches will remain free until Microsoft releases an official fix.
