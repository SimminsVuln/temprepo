Summary
Atlassian has disclosed CVE-2025-66516, an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability stemming from the Apache Tika dependency used across multiple Atlassian Data Center and Server products, specifically Bamboo, Confluence, Crowd, Jira Service Management, and Jira Software. The issue affects only the products listed above and is tied to how these applications process certain XML-based content through Tika. As of the advisory, no public exploits or proof-of-concept (PoC) code have been reported in the wild, and Atlassian has assessed the real-world risk as lower than critical due to implementation constraints within their products. Nevertheless, Atlassian has released fixed versions and strongly recommends patching to prevent potential abuse as exploit techniques evolve.

Current Condition
The vulnerability is an XXE (XML External Entity Injection) issue within the Apache Tika library, which could allow an attacker to manipulate XML parsing to read local files, perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), or trigger denial-of-service conditions under certain circumstances. While the upstream dependency vulnerability is considered high impact, Atlassian’s usage limits direct exploitability, reducing the likelihood of immediate compromise. The flaw is fully addressed by upgrading to the vendor-provided fixed releases of the affected Atlassian Data Center and Server products. Patch management teams should ensure these systems are updated, especially in environments where untrusted content can be processed.
