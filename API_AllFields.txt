Short Summary
On December 17th, Cisco issued a critical security advisory warning of active exploitation of CVE-2025-20393, an unpatched zero-day vulnerability affecting Cisco AsyncOS appliances. The advisory highlights confirmed in-the-wild attacks targeting exposed systems, elevating the urgency for organizations running affected Secure Email Gateway (SEG) and Secure Email and Web Manager (SEWM) products to take immediate defensive action.

Current Condition
CVE-2025-20393 is a maximum-severity improper input validation vulnerability (CWE-20) in Cisco AsyncOS software affecting SEG and SEWM products, with a CVSS score of 10.0. When the Spam Quarantine feature is enabled and reachable from the internet, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying system, enabling full control. Cisco Talos attributes active exploitation to a sophisticated China-nexus APT tracked as UAT-9686, which deploys custom backdoors (e.g., AquaShell), reverse SSH tunnels (AquaTunnel/Chisel), and log-clearing tools (AquaPurge) to maintain persistence and evade detection. There is currently no patch available, so Cisco recommends restricting internet exposure, tightening access controls, monitoring logs, and rebuilding compromised appliances to mitigate risk until a fix is released.
