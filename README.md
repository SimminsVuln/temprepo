Hey!
Iâ€™ve been thinking about some fun things we could do if youâ€™re up for a day in Seattle. A few options I had in mindâ€”nothing set in stoneâ€”just curious what sounds interesting to you.

We could check out Elliott Bay Book Company, which is a really cool indie bookstore, or walk around Lake Union (maybe even kayak if the weatherâ€™s nice), or explore Pike Place Market and find somewhere for lunch or dinner nearby.

There are also some events going on that might be fun in addition to everything above:

If weâ€™re aiming for July 14th weekend:
A screening of High Fidelity followed by a Q&A with John Cusack (Iâ€™ve never seen the movie but it might be cool).
A performance by They Might Be Giantsâ€”kind of a quirky, fun band. I love them but no pressure if theyâ€™re not your vibe.
Thereâ€™s also this Cirque-du-Soleil-style show called Duel Reality, which is like acrobatics meets Romeo and Juliet. It sounds wildâ€¦ in a good way lol.

On June 21st:
There is a monthly Columbia City night market that takes place between 6 and 10pm that has food artwork and live performances.
Eastside concert from "Beyond the Sea" which is a musical trio. - Never heard of them.

On July 5th, not much is going on, probably July 4th recovery, I might go see a Baseball game on July 4th though I like going to at least one MLB game a year.

July 11th
My Chemical Romance is playing at T-Mobile. I had a full emo phase in high school, and I still love their second album, so that oneâ€™s just for funâ€¦ but I might go regardless ðŸ˜‚

July 21st
Katy Perry is playing. I mean I'm super familiar with her music other than I guess she is an astronaut or something now? but if you are it might be fun.


Let me know if any of that sounds funâ€”or if you have other ideas! Iâ€™m open.
